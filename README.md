Simple java-programmed game using object-oriented programming.

How It Works:
Your main character is spawned in the middle of the screen and enemies will start spawning at random directions, infinitely.

Slaying enemies will make them drop coins which the main character can collect, using them to make upgrades to its stats, such as damage, bullet speed and HP.

The game keeps track of score based on time spent alive in the game, and it ends when your HP reaches 0, saving the result in a text file.

Controls:
WASD to move, HOLD mouse click for shooting bullets at set intervals.

Enjoy!
